## 1. Overview
This guide describes how to build MIE from source code and how to build applications that use MIE as a back-end for executing multimedia workflows. This guide is intended for software developers who have experience working with the AWS Cloud.

## 2. Prerequisites

You must have the following build tools in order to build MIE and the Media Insights front-end application:

* AWS CLI - configured
* Docker - installed and running

## 3. Building the MIE framework from source code

Run the following commands to build and deploy MIE cloud formation templates from scratch. Be sure to define values for `MIE_STACK_NAME` and `REGION` first.

```
MIE_STACK_NAME=[YOUR STACK NAME]
REGION=[YOUR REGION]
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-media-insights-engine
cd aws-media-insights-engine (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-media-insights-engine)
git checkout development_merge_isolated (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-media-insights-engine/tree/development_merge_isolated) 
cd deployment
VERSION=1.0.0
DATETIME=$(date '+%s')
DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=media-insights-engine-$DATETIME-dist
TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=media-insights-engine-$DATETIME
aws s3 mb s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION --region $REGION
./build-s3-dist.sh --template-bucket $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET --code-bucket $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET --version $VERSION --region $REGION | tee >( grep TEMPLATE >template )
TEMPLATE=$(cat template | cut -f 2 -d "'")
rm -f template 
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name $MIE_STACK_NAME --template-url $TEMPLATE --region $REGION --parameters ParameterKey=DeployTestResources,ParameterValue=true ParameterKey=EnableXrayTrace,ParameterValue=true ParameterKey=MaxConcurrentWorkflows,ParameterValue=10 ParameterKey=DeployAnalyticsPipeline,ParameterValue=true --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND --profile default --disable-rollback
```

After the stack finished deploying then you should see the following 6 nested stacks (with slightly different names than shown below):

<img src="doc/images/stack_resources.png" width=300>

After the stack finishes deploying then remove the temporary build bucket like this:

```
aws s3 rb s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION --region $REGION --profile default --force
```

## 4. Implementing a new Operator in MIE

Operators are Lambda functions that:

* derive new media objects from input media and/or
* generate metadata by analyzing input media.

Operators run as part of an MIE workflow. Workflows are [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) that define the order in which operators run.

Operators can be _synchronous_ or _asynchronous_.  Synchronous operators start an  analysis (or transformation) job and get its result in a single Lambda function. Async operators use separate Lambda functions to start jobs and get their results. Typically, async operators run for several minutes.

Operator inputs can include a list of media, metadata and the user-defined workflow and/or operator configurations.

Operator outputs include the execution status, and S3 locators for the newly derived media and metadata objects saved in S3. These outputs get passed to other operators in downstream workflow stages.

Operators should interact with the MIE data persistence layer via the `MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper`, which is located under [source/lib/MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper/](source/lib/MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper/MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper/__init__.py).

### Step 1: Write operator Lambda functions
***(Difficulty: >1 hour)***

*TL;DR - Copy `source/operators/rekognition/generic_data_lookup.py` to a new directory and change it to do what you want.*

Operators live under `source/operators`.  Create a new folder there for your new operator.

The MIE Helper library should be used inside an operator to interact with the control plane and data plane. This library lives under `lib/MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper/`.

#### Using the MIE Helper library

Instantiate the helper like this:

```
from MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper import OutputHelper
output_object = OutputHelper("my_operator_name")
```

#### How to get Asset and Workflow IDs

Get the Workflow and Asset ID from the Lambda's entrypoint event object:

```
# Lambda function entrypoint:
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    workflow_id = str(event["WorkflowExecutionId"])
    asset_id = event['AssetId']
```

#### How to get input Media Objects

Media objects are passed using their location in S3.  Use the `boto3` S3 client access them from S3 using the locations specified in the Lambda's entrypoint event object:

```
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    if "Video" in event["Input"]["Media"]:
        s3bucket = event["Input"]["Media"]["Video"]["S3Bucket"]
        s3key = event["Input"]["Media"]["Video"]["S3Key"]
    elif "Image" in event["Input"]["Media"]:
        s3bucket = event["Input"]["Media"]["Image"]["S3Bucket"]
        s3key = event["Input"]["Media"]["Image"]["S3Key"]
```

#### How to get operator configuration input

Operator configurations can be accessed from the "Configuration" attribute in the Lambda's entrypoint event object. For example, here's how the face search operator gets the user-specified face collection id:

```
collection_id = event["Configuration"]["CollectionId"]
```

#### How to write data to downstream operators

Metadata derived by an operator can be passed as input to the next stage in a workflow by adding said data to the operator's `output_object`. Do this with the `add_workflow_metadata` function in the OutputHelper, as shown below:

***The values for attributes must be strings.***
***The values for attributes must not be empty strings.***

```
from MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper import OutputHelper
output_object = OutputHelper(operator_name)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ...
    # Passing MyData objects to downstream operators 
    output_object.add_workflow_metadata(MyData1=my_data_1)
    output_object.add_workflow_metadata(MyData2=my_data_2)
    # Multiple key value pairs can also be specified as a list, like this:
    output_object.add_workflow_metadata(MyData3=my_data_3, MyData4=my_data_4)
    ...
    return output_object.return_output_object()
```        

#### How to read data from upstream operators

Metadata that was output by upstream operators can be accessed from the Lambda's entrypoint event object, like this:

```
my_data_1 = event["Input"]["MetaData"]["MyData1"]
```

#### How to store media metadata to the data plane

Use `store_asset_metadata()` to store results. For paged results, call that function for each page.

```
from MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper import DataPlane
dataplane = DataPlane()
metadata_upload = dataplane.store_asset_metadata(asset_id, operator_name, workflow_id, response)
```

#### Store media objects to the data plane S3 bucket

Operators can derive new media objects. For example, the Transcribe operator derives a new text object from an input audio object. Save new media objects with `add_media_object()`, like this:

```
from MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper import MediaInsightsOperationHelper
operator_object = MediaInsightsOperationHelper(event)
operator_object.add_media_object(my_media_type, bucket, key)
```

The `my_media_type` variable should be "Video", "Audio", or "Text".

#### Retrieve media objects from the data plane

```
from MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper import MediaInsightsOperationHelper
operator_object = MediaInsightsOperationHelper(event)
bucket = operator_object.input["Media"][my_media_type]["S3Bucket"]
key = operator_object.input["Media"][my_media_type]["S3Key"]
s3_response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
```

Again, the `my_media_type` variable should be "Video", "Audio", or "Text".

### Step 2: Add your operator to the MIE operator library
***(Difficulty: 30 minutes)***

*TL;DR - Edit `source/operators/operator-library.yaml` and add new entries for your operator under the following sections:*

* `# Lambda Functions`
* `# IAM Roles`
* `# Register as operators in the control plane`
* `# Export operator names as outputs`

This step involves editing the CloudFormation script for deploying the MIE operator library, located at [`source/operators/operator-library.yaml`](source/operators/operator-library.yaml).

#### Create the IAM Role resource

Create a CloudFormation IAM resource that will be used to give your Lambda function the appropriate permissions. MIE operators need `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` plus policies for any other AWS resource and services accessed by the Lambda function.

#### Create Lambda Function resource

Create a CloudFormation `Lambda::Function` resource for your Operator Lambda function.  If your Operator is _Async_, make sure to also register your monitoring Lambda function.

#### Create the MIE Operator resource using your Lambda function(s)

The MIE Operator custom resource has the following attributes:

```
Type: Custom:CustomResource
Properties:
  ServiceToken: !Ref WorkflowCustomResourceArn
  ResourceType:
    ResourceType
  Name: 
    Name
  Type:
    Type
  Configuration: 
    Configuration
  StartLambdaArn:
    StartLambdaArn
  MonitorLambdaArn:
    MonitorLambdaArn
  StateMachineExecutionRoleArn: !GetAtt StepFunctionRole.Arn
```

***ResourceType***

* Specify the type of resource: `"Operator"`, `"Workflow"`, or `"Stage"`

***Name***

* Specify the name of your Operator

***Type***

* Specify whether your operator is `Sync` or `Async`

***Configuration***

* Specify the `MediaType` and `Enabled` fields and add any other configurations needed

***StartLambdaArn***

* Specify the ARN of the Lambda function to start your Operator

***MonitorLambdaArn***

* If your operator is _Async_, specify the ARN of the monitoring Lambda function

#### Export your Operator name as an output

Export your operator as an output like this:
```
  MyOperation:
    Description: "Operation name of MyOperation"
    Value: !GetAtt MyOperation.Name
    Export:
      Name: !Join [":", [!Ref "AWS::StackName", MyOperation]]
```

### Step 3: Add your operator to a workflow
***(Difficulty: 10 minutes)***

*TL;DR - Edit `cloudformation/aws-content-analysis-video-workflow.yaml` and add your operator under `Resources --> defaultVideoStage --> Operations`*

It's easiest to create a new workflow by copying end editing on of the existing workflows in the `cloudformation/` directory. A workflow consists of one or more stages. Operators in the same stage will run at the same time (i.e. "in parallel") and stages will run one at a time. The workflow defines the order in which stages sequentially run.

### Step 4: Update the build script to deploy your operator to AWS Lambda
***(Difficulty: 5 minutes)***

Update the "`Make lambda package`" section in [`build-s3-dist.sh`](deployment/build-s3-dist.sh) to zip your operator's Lambda function(s) into the `deployment/dist` directory, like this:

```
zip -r9 my_operator.zip my_operator.py
```

### Step 5: Deploy your custom build

Run the build script to generate cloud formation templates then deploy them as described in the [README](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-media-insights/blob/old_dev_webapp_merge/README.md#build-from-source)

### Step 6: Test your new workflow and operator

To test workflows and operators, you will submit requests to the workflow API endpoint using AWS_IAM authorization. Tools like [Postman](README.md#Security) (as described in the [README](README.md#Security)) and [awscurl](https://github.com/okigan/awscurl) make AWS_IAM authorization easy. The following examples assume your AWS access key and secret key are set up as required by awscurl:

*Sample command to list all available workflows:*
```
awscurl "$WORKFLOW_API_ENDPOINT"/workflow | cut -f 2 -d "'" | jq '.[].Name'
```

*Sample command to list all stages in a workflow:*
```
WORKFLOW_NAME="CasImageWorkflow"
awscurl "$WORKFLOW_API_ENDPOINT"/workflow/"$WORKFLOW_NAME" | cut -f 2 -d "'" | jq -c '.Stages | .[].Name'
```

*Sample command to get the workflow configuration for a stage:*
```
WORKFLOW_NAME="CasImageWorkflow"
STAGE_NAME="RekognitionStage"
awscurl "$WORKFLOW_API_ENDPOINT"/workflow/"$WORKFLOW_NAME" | cut -f 2 -d "'" | jq -c '.Stages."$STAGE_NAME".Configuration'
```

*Sample command to run a workflow with the default configuration:*
```
WORKFLOW_NAME="CasImageWorkflow"
aws s3 cp test_image.jpg s3://"$DATAPLANE_BUCKET"/ 
awscurl -X POST --data '{"Name":"$WORKFLOW_NAME", "Input":{"Media":{"Image":{"S3Bucket":"'$DATAPLANE_BUCKET'","S3Key":"test_image.jpg"}}}}' $WORKFLOW_API_ENDPOINT/workflow/execution 
```

*Sample command to run a workflow with a non-default configuration:*
```
WORKFLOW_NAME="CasImageWorkflow"
CONFIGURATION='{"RekognitionStage":{"faceDetectionImage":{"MediaType":"Image","Enabled":false},"celebrityRecognitionImage":{"MediaType":"Image","Enabled":false},"faceSearchImage":{"MediaType":"Image","Enabled":false},"contentModerationImage":{"MediaType":"Image","Enabled":false},"labelDetectionImage":{"MediaType":"Image","Enabled":false}}}'
aws s3 cp test_image.jpg s3://"$DATAPLANE_BUCKET"/ 
awscurl -X POST --data '{"Name":"'$WORKFLOW_NAME'", "Configuration":'$CONFIGURATION', "Input":{"Media":{"Image":{"S3Bucket":"'$DATAPLANE_BUCKET'","S3Key":"test_image.jpg"}}}}' $WORKFLOW_API_ENDPOINT/workflow/execution
```

#### Monitor your test

You can monitor workflows with the following logs:

* Your operator lambda. To find this log, search the Lambda functions for your operator name.
* The data plane API lambda. To find this log, search Lambda functions for "MediaInsightsDataplaneApiStack".

#### Validate metadata in the data plane

When your operator finishes successfully then you can see data saved from the `Dataplane.store_asset_metadata()` function in the following DynamoDB table:

# 5. Implementing a new data stream consumer

The data plane stores each item as an object in S3 and stores their S3 object identifier in DynamoDB. However, many application scenarios involve data access patterns that require capabilities beyond those provided by DynamoDB and S3. For example, Elasticsearch may be needed to support interactive analytics, Amazon SNS may be needed to provide real-time messaging and notifications, or Amazon Quicksight may be need to support analytical reporting over big data sets.

The data plane provides a change-data-capture (CDC) stream from DynamoDB to communicate media analysis data to stream consumers where ETL tasks can transform and load raw data to the downstream data stores that support end-user applications. This CDC stream is provided as a Kinesis Data Stream. The ARN for this is provided as an output called `AnalyticsStreamArn` in the base MIE CloudFormation stack, as shown below:

<img src="doc/images/analytics_stream_output.png" width=400>

For more information about how to implement Kinesis Data Stream consumers in MIE, check out the [MIE demo application](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-media-insights/blob/master/README.md#advanced-usage), which includes a data stream consumer that feeds Elasticsearch.

* Create a new operation

  `POST /workflow/operation`

  Generates an operation state machine using the operation lambda(s) provided.

  Creates a singleton operator stage that can be used to run the operator as a single-operator stage in a workflow.

  Operators can be synchronous (Sync) or asynchronous (Async). Synchronous operators complete before returning control to the invoker, while asynchronous operators return control to the invoker immediately after the operation is successfully initiated. Asynchronous operators require an additional monitoring task to check the status of the operation.

  ***Update (January 29, 2021):*** Do not try to create more than 35 new operators via `/workflow/operation`. The IAM inline policy used in `media-insights-stack.yaml` to grant `InvokeFunction` permission to the `StepFunctionRole` for new operators will exceed the maximum length allowed by IAM if users create more than 35 operators (+/- 1).
  
  For more information, see the comments in this commit:
  [awslabs/aws-media-insights-engine@451ec2e](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-media-insights-engine/commit/451ec2edc04881dd8947d5855e9145f51056465f)
  
  Here is a sample command that shows how to create an operator from `/workflow/operation` on the command line:
  
  ```
  OPERATOR_NAME="op1"
  WORKFLOW_API_ENDPOINT="https://tvplry8vn3.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/api/"
  START_ARN="arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:773074507832:function:mie03d-OperatorFailedLambda-11W1LAY0CWCUZ"
  MONITOR_ARN="arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:773074507832:function:mie03d-OperatorFailedLambda-11W1LAY0CWCUZ"

## How to enable AWS X-Ray request tracing for MIE

AWS X-Ray traces requests through the AWS platform.  It is especially useful for performance debugging, but also helps with other types of debugging by making it easy to follow what happened with a request end to end across AWS services, even when the request triggered execution across multiple AWS accounts.

The AWS X-Ray service has a perpetual free tier.  When free tier limits are exceeded X-Ray tracing incurs charges as outlined by the [X-Ray pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/pricing/) page.


### Enable tracing from Lambda entry points

By default, tracing for MIE is disabled.  You can enable AWS X-Ray tracing for MIE requests by updating the MIE stack with the **EnableXrayTrace** CloudFormation parameter to `true` .  When tracing is enabled,  all supported services that are invoked for the request will be traced starting from MIE Lambda entry points. These entry point Lambdas are as follows:

* WorkflowAPIHandler
* WorkflowCustomResource
* WorkflowScheduler
* DataplaneAPIHandler

### Enable tracing from API Gateway entry points

Additionally, you can enable tracing for API Gateway requests in the AWS Console by checking  the *Enable tracing* option for the deployed API Gateway stages for both the Workflow API and the Data plane API.  See the [AWS console documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-services-apigateway.html) for more info.

### Developing custom tracing in MIE lambda functions

MIE Lambdas import the [X-Ray Python packages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-python.html) and patch any supported libraries at runtime. MIE Lambdas are ready for future instrumentation by developers using the X-Ray Python packages.

The MIE Lambda Layer contains all the packages dependencies needed to support X-Ray, so they are available to any new Lambdas that use the Layer.

## MIE workflow error handling

When you create MIE workflows, MIE automatically creates state machines for you with built-in error handling.

There are two levels of error handling in MIE workflows state machines:  Operator error handling and Workflow error handling.

### Operator error handling

#### Operator lambda code

Operator lambdas can use the `MasExecutionError` property from the `MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper` python library to consistently handle errors that occur within the lambda code of MIE Operators.

The following is an example of lambda function error handling used in the **ENTITIES** (Comprehend) operator:

``` python
from MediaInsightsEngineLambdaHelper import MasExecutionError

try:
    ...
except Exception as e:
    operator_object.update_workflow_status("Error")
    operator_object.add_workflow_metadata(comprehend_entity_job_id=job_id, comprehend_error="comprehend returned as failed: {e}".format(e=response["EntitiesDetectionJobPropertiesList"][0]["Message"]))
    raise MasExecutionError(operator_object.return_output_object())
```

This code updates the outputs of the operator within the workflow_execution results with the error status, specific error information for this failure then raises an exception.  The exception will trigger the `Catch` and `Retry` error handling within the state machine (see next section).

#### Operator state machine ASL error handling

Operators use `Catch` and `Retry` to handle errors that occur in the steps of the operator state machine tasks.  If a step returns an error, the operator is retried.  If retry attempts fail, then the **OperatorFailed** lambda resource is invoked to handle the error by making sure the workflow_execution object contains the error status, specific information about the failure and the workflow execution error status is propagated to the control plane. The following is an example of the `Catch` and `Retry` states using Amazon States Language (ASL) for MIE state machine error handling:

``` json
{
    ...
    "Retry": [ {
        "ErrorEquals": ["Lambda.ServiceException", "Lambda.AWSLambdaException", "Lambda.SdkClientException", "Lambda.Unknown", "MasExecutionError"],
        "IntervalSeconds": 2,
        "MaxAttempts": 2,
        "BackoffRate": 2
    }],
    "Catch": [{
        "ErrorEquals": ["States.ALL"],
        "Next": "<OPERATION_NAME> Failed (<STAGE_NAME>)",
        "ResultPath": "$.Outputs"
        }]
    ...

```

#### Workflow state machine error handling

If an error occurs in the Step Function service that causes the state machine execution for an MIE workflow to be terminated immediately, then the `Catch` and `Retry` and **OperatorFailed** lambda will not be able to handle the error.  These types of errors can occur in a number of circumstances.  For example, when the Step Function history limit is exceeded, or the execution is Stopped (aborted) from the AWS console.  Failure to handle these errors will the workflow in a perpetually `Started` status in the MIE control plane.

The **WorkflowErrorHandlerLambda:** lambda resource is triggered when the Step Functions service emits `Step Functions Execution Status Change` EventBridge events that have an error status (`FAILED, TIMED_OUT, ABORTED`).  The error handler propagates the error to the MIE control plane if the workflow is not already completed.

# 8. Glossary

## Workflow API
Triggers the execution of a workflow. Also triggers create, update and delete workflows and operators.  Monitors the status of workflows.

## Control plane
Executes the AWS Step Functions state machine for the workflow against the provided input.  Workflow state machines are generated from MIE operators.  As operators within the state machine are executed, they interact with the MIE data plane to store and retrieve media objects and data files.

## Operators
Generated state machines that perform media analysis or transformation operation.

## Workflows
Generated state machines that execute a number of operators in sequence.

## Data plane
Stores media assets and their associated metadata that are generated by workflows.

## Data plane API

Trigger create, update, delete and retrieval of media assets and their associated metadata.

## Data plane pipeline

Stores metadata for an asset that can be retrieved as a single block or pages of data using the objects AssetId and Metadata type.  Writing data to the pipeline triggers a copy of the data to be stored in a **Kinesis Stream**.

### **Data plane pipeline consumer**

A lambda function that consumes data from the data plane pipeline and stores it (or acts on it) in another downstream data store.  Data can be stored in different kinds of data stores to fit the data management and query needs of the application. There may be 0 or more pipeline consumers in a MIE application.
